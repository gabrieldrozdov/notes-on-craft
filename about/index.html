				Welcome to Notes on Craft—a site for open exchange about the word craft and the role it plays in our current contemporary culture. In its first and primary definition, craft is described as “skill in planning, making, and executing something,” or what we might otherwise call dexterity. Our most prominent association with the word is perhaps its second definition: “an occupation, trade, or activity requiring manual dexterity or artistic skill.” These are often things that are learned by apprenticeship, passed down from one skilled craftsman to another. If we look backwards at the 1913 record of Webster’s, we see “strength, might and secret power,” an etymological view of the word that reveals the association of craft with virtuosity.

				To perform a practice of a certain repetitive quality requires not just virtue, but impenetrable space, time and discipline. This kind of rigor used to mark the craftsman with honor. But with the rise in popularity of conceptual and perceptual art forms, the art world began to sully the word. This project is an attempt at reinvigorating engagement with this word. Through conversations with individuals pursuing numerous simultaneous occupations—some of them requiring rigorous engagement of the artist’s hand, others less obviously so—we ask practitioners, How would you describe the labor inherent to your creative practice? Does the word craft fall short? In a curious apprenticeship with the word, and through the stories of others, the hope is that visitors and contributors to the site can begin to define craft entirely for themselves.
