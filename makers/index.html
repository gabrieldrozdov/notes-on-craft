				Zoë Pulley [b.1993] is a designer and maker who utilizes stuff to surface the seemingly ordinary stories of Black folks through mixed media, typography, and audio. She defines “stuff” as artifacts both physical and nonphysical that may be relegated as unimportant to some—as merely stuff. Most recently, Pulley has shown work  in a group exhibition, <em><a href="https://newportartmuseum.org/exhibitions/dress-code/">Dress Code</a></em> at the Newport Art Museum and a performance at RISD Museum. Her practice includes ongoing collaborations such as a wearable line inspired by her grandmother called <a href="https://www.gransans.com/">GRAN SANS</a> and a collectively authored publication titled <a href="https://www.blackjoyarchive.com/">Black Joy Archive</a>. In 2021 she designed a zine for <em>Combahee’s Radical Call: Black Feminisms (re)Awaken Boston</em> at the Boston Center for the Arts. Her work is held in the collections of The Valentine Museum, the Hardvard Radcliffe Institute, and Printed Matter. Pulley is an inaugural recipient of the Rhode Island School of Design Society of Presidential Fellowship and was awarded the <a href="https://gdusa.com/studentstowatch2023/zoe-pulley">Graduate Graphic Designer to Watch by GDUSA</a> in 2023. She earned a BFA from Virginia Commonwealth University in 2015 and an MFA in graphic design from Rhode Island School of Design. Pulley is currently an Artist-In-Residence at <a href="https://www.studiomuseum.org/">The Studio Museum In Harlem</a>.

				Jan Rybczynski “yawn rib-chin-ski” [b.2001] s a multi-disciplinary artist who recently graduated from the Rhode Island School of Design, with a degree in Furniture Design and a concentration in Nature, Culture, and Sustainability Studies. Born and raised in Boulder, Colorado, Rybczynski holds a deep appreciation for the beauty within the natural world in all of its subtle complexity. Spanning from furniture to sculpture, his work is inspired by the physical attributes of the nine biomes of Earth and the beings which inhabit them, employing materials that lend themselves to the craftsmanship and physical process required to work them. The resulting work provokes the limits of material and process, drawing out the harmonious relationship between craft and the inherent beauty of the environment. Through continued exploration, Rybczynski aims to build a sustainable practice which meshes material, process, and historical/cultural context.  A structure which will allow him to create work while treating the environment with kindness and respect, make room for the lifelong study of craft. In addition, Rybczynski is currently serving as a Student Trustee on the board of directors for the <a href="https://furnsoc.org/">Furniture Society</a>and will soon be starting as a Core Fellow at Penland School of Craft.
