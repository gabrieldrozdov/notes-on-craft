    "bio": "A self-taught quilter, Cedar Kerwin [b. 1993] uses found fabrics and secondhand clothes to make functional quilts and quilted artworks that range from flamboyantly colorful to muted and moody. Sometimes recognizable variations of geometrics patterns, and other times completely improvised between the cutting mat, design board and sewing machine, their quilts range both in size and style. Repurposing and collecting are critical to their practice. One of the themes they think about in their work is the idea of imagined memory, or creating new visual worlds for memories or feelings. By using already existing everyday materials, there’s a feeling of gathering and connecting the stories already present in the fabric, and then getting to give them new life in unexpected ways. Quilting was Kerwin‘s first exploration into abstraction. They found access to another language of visual expression. Somehow transmuting the unsaid/verbally untranslatable into images or in this case, objects. Cedar’s arts background is in printmaking. They reveived a BA in Studio Art from UC Santa Cruz in 2015, and their <a href=\"https://tamarind.unm.edu/education/printer-training-program/\">Professional Printer Certification from Tamarind Institute </a> in 2017. Their background in crafts and appreciation for the handmade comes from growing up in a small rural town surrounded by people who worked with their hands. They are currently based in Queens, NY.",

    "bio": "Zoë Pulley [b.1993] is a designer and maker who utilizes stuff to surface the seemingly ordinary stories of Black folks through mixed media, typography, and audio. She defines “stuff” as artifacts both physical and nonphysical that may be relegated as unimportant to some—as merely stuff. Most recently, Pulley has shown work  in a group exhibition, <em><a href=\"https://newportartmuseum.org/exhibitions/dress-code/\">Dress Code</a></em> at the Newport Art Museum and a performance at RISD Museum. Her practice includes ongoing collaborations such as a wearable line inspired by her grandmother called <a href=\"https://www.gransans.com/\">GRAN SANS</a> and a collectively authored publication titled <a href=\"https://www.blackjoyarchive.com/\">Black Joy Archive</a>. In 2021 she designed a zine for <em>Combahee’s Radical Call: Black Feminisms (re)Awaken Boston</em> at the Boston Center for the Arts. Her work is held in the collections of The Valentine Museum, the Hardvard Radcliffe Institute, and Printed Matter. Pulley is an inaugural recipient of the Rhode Island School of Design Society of Presidential Fellowship and was awarded the <a href=\"https://gdusa.com/studentstowatch2023/zoe-pulley\">Graduate Graphic Designer to Watch by GDUSA</a> in 2023. She earned a BFA from Virginia Commonwealth University in 2015 and an MFA in graphic design from Rhode Island School of Design. Pulley is currently an Artist-In-Residence at <a href=\"https://www.studiomuseum.org/\">The Studio Museum In Harlem</a>.",

Born and raised in Boulder, Colorado, Rybczynski holds a deep appreciation for the beauty within the natural world in all of its subtle complexity. Spanning from furniture to sculpture, his work is inspired by the physical attributes of the nine biomes of Earth and the beings which inhabit them, employing materials that lend themselves to the craftsmanship and physical process required to work them. The resulting work provokes the limits of material and process, drawing out the harmonious relationship between craft and the inherent beauty of the environment. Through continued exploration, Rybczynski aims to build a sustainable practice which meshes material, process, and historical/cultural context.  A structure which will allow him to create work while treating the environment with kindness and respect, make room for the lifelong study of craft. In addition, Rybczynski is currently serving as a Student Trustee on the board of directors for the <a href=\"https://furnsoc.org/\">Furniture Society</a>and will soon be starting as a Core Fellow at Penland School of Craft.",

I shall be a clinger to the outsides of words all my life. Yet I could not live with him and suffer his stupidity. He will coarsen and snore. He will marry and there will be scenes of tenderness at breakfast. But now he is young. Not a thread, not a sheet of paper lies between him and the sun, between him and the rain, between him and the moon as he lies naked, tumbled, hot, on his bed. Now as they drive along the high road in their brake his face is mottled red and yellow. He will throw off his coat and stand with his legs apart, with his hands ready, watching the wicket. And he will pray, “Lord let us win”; he will think of one thing only, that they should win.",
