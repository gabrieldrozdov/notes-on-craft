								There is a vitality, a life force, a quickening that is translated through you into action, and there is only one of you in all time. This expression is unique, and if you block it, it will never exist through any other medium, and be lost. The world will not have it. It is not your business to determine how good it is, nor how it compares with other expression. It is your business to keep it yours clearly and directly, to keep the channel open. You do not even have to believe in yourself or your work. You have to keep open and aware directly to the urges that motivate you. Keep the channel open.

						I have two activities, which are interesting economically; you can buy my work in a gallery, and see it in many museums' famous collections as artworks in frames . . . Or, you can get all this material from me by mail for free, if I decide to send it to you.
