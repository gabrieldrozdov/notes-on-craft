								<p class="notes-header-def">Craft might be thought of in parallel with practice. It is something that involves an element of manual construction. In my photography this “manipulation” occurs in the construction of a scene. I shape the light and re-stage things. Prior to the physical production of the photograph however, there are blurry methods of envisioning things or coming upon images. Whether that should be defined as my <em>practice</em> or <em>craft</em>, I try to leave enough space open in my days for those moments of sudden clarity. Often they occur when I am taking a long walk.</p>
